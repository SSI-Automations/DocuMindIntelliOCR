# DocuMind IntelliOCR - Product Requirements Document

# Overview  
DocuMind IntelliOCR is a generic OCR document processing application designed for **B2B software sales** rather than SaaS. Companies purchase the base application and receive customization services for their specific industry needs. The product solves the critical problem of manual document processing by providing accurate, fast OCR capabilities with a professional interface that can be tailored to any business vertical.

**Problem Solved**: Manual document digitization is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive for businesses across all industries. Current enterprise OCR solutions are prohibitively expensive and lock companies into ongoing subscription costs.

**Target Market**: Mid-to-large enterprises needing document processing solutions across insurance, legal, healthcare, accounting, logistics, and other document-heavy industries.

**Value Proposition**:
- Own the software outright with no ongoing API costs
- 99%+ OCR accuracy using Mistral AI at just $1/1000 pages
- 95% cost reduction vs enterprise solutions ($3.75/month vs $225-$22,500/month)
- Ready-to-customize foundation for industry-specific needs
- Professional enterprise-ready UI built with modern technologies

**Business Model**: License sales ($10K-$25K) + customization services ($50K-$200K) + annual support contracts ($5K-$15K)

# Risks and Mitigations  

## Technical Challenges

### Risk: Mistral OCR Integration Complexity
**Impact**: Core functionality depends on external API working correctly
**Mitigation**:
- Test Mistral OCR with sample documents immediately
- Implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Have fallback processing options ready
- Create mock service for development continuity

### Risk: File Upload and Storage Performance
**Impact**: Poor user experience with large files or slow uploads
**Mitigation**:
- Implement chunked upload for large files
- Add upload progress indicators and cancellation
- Set reasonable file size limits (50MB max)
- Use Supabase Storage CDN for optimal performance

### Risk: Real-time Processing Status Updates
**Impact**: Users don't know processing status, leading to poor UX
**Mitigation**:
- Implement WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for live updates
- Have polling fallback for connection issues
- Clear loading states and estimated time indicators
- Graceful handling of processing timeouts

## MVP Scope Management

### Risk: Feature Creep During Development
**Impact**: Timeline extends, core functionality gets delayed
**Mitigation**:
- Strict adherence to Phase 1-4 scope for MVP
- Document Phase 5-7 features as post-MVP only
- Regular scope review and client expectation management
- Focus on demonstrable core value first

### Risk: Over-Engineering for Future Customizations
**Impact**: Unnecessary complexity delays MVP delivery
**Mitigation**:
- Build simple, working features first
- Refactor for extensibility only after MVP validation
- Document customization points for future development
- Prioritize working demo over architectural perfection

## Resource and Timeline Constraints

### Risk: Dependency on External Services
**Impact**: Service outages or changes could block development
**Mitigation**:
- Have local development environment setup
- Monitor service status and maintain backup plans
- Keep API integration modular for easier swapping
- Document all external service configurations

### Risk: Insufficient Testing Before Client Demo
**Impact**: Demo failures damage credibility and sales potential
**Mitigation**:
- Test with multiple document types and sizes
- Have backup demo materials and recorded videos
- Practice demo flow multiple times
- Prepare for common failure scenarios
