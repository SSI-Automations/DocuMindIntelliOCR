# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Supabase Storage Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up secure file storage with Supabase Storage including bucket configuration and file upload persistence
# Details:
1) Create private storage bucket with proper security policies, 2) Configure file upload to save files to user-specific folders (/user_id/filename), 3) Implement signed URL generation for secure file access, 4) Add file metadata tracking (size, type, upload timestamp), 5) Set up automatic cleanup for failed uploads, 6) Configure 50MB file size limits and supported MIME types (PDF, PNG, JPG, TIFF). Use Supabase Storage JavaScript client with proper error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test file upload with various file types and sizes. Verify user isolation - users cannot access other users' files. Test signed URL generation and expiration. Validate file size limits and type restrictions.
