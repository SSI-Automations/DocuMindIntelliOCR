# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create Processing History Page
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build comprehensive document history interface with filtering and management capabilities
# Details:
1) Create /history page with table view of all user documents, 2) Display document name, upload date, processing status, file size, and actions, 3) Implement filtering by status (completed, processing, failed) and date range, 4) Add search functionality by filename, 5) Enable document re-access - click to view results again, 6) Implement document deletion with confirmation dialog, 7) Add bulk operations (delete multiple, re-process failed), 8) Show processing statistics (total documents, success rate, storage used).

# Test Strategy:
Test history page loads all user documents correctly. Verify filtering and search work properly. Test document re-access functionality. Validate deletion removes all associated data. Test bulk operations with multiple selections.
