# Task ID: 11
# Title: Optimize Performance and Loading States
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement performance optimizations and professional loading states throughout the application
# Details:
1) Add skeleton loading screens for all major components, 2) Implement lazy loading for heavy components and images, 3) Add caching for frequently accessed data (user profile, recent documents), 4) Optimize database queries with proper indexing, 5) Implement pagination for document history, 6) Add image optimization for document previews, 7) Implement service worker for offline capability, 8) Add performance monitoring and metrics collection.

# Test Strategy:
Test loading states appear correctly during data fetching. Verify lazy loading improves initial page load time. Test caching reduces redundant API calls. Validate pagination works with large document sets. Test offline functionality where applicable.
