# Task ID: 1
# Title: Complete Supabase Authentication Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement complete Supabase authentication backend integration with user management and session handling
# Details:
Following SUPABASE_SETUP.md documentation: 1) Configure Supabase client with environment variables, 2) Implement authentication middleware for route protection, 3) Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user data isolation, 4) Create user profile management, 5) Implement secure session handling with automatic token refresh. Use Supabase Auth with TypeScript for type safety. Ensure proper error handling for auth failures and network issues.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, logout flows. Verify RLS policies prevent cross-user data access. Test session persistence across browser refreshes. Validate middleware blocks unauthorized access to protected routes.
