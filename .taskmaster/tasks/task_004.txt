# Task ID: 4
# Title: Connect File Upload to Database
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate existing file upload component with Supabase storage and database persistence
# Details:
Modify existing React Dropzone upload component: 1) On file selection, upload to Supabase Storage, 2) Create database record in documents table with file metadata, 3) Update upload progress with real storage progress, 4) Handle upload failures with proper cleanup (remove partial files and database records), 5) Set document status to 'uploaded' on success, 6) Implement file validation before upload (type, size checks), 7) Add duplicate file detection and handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test complete upload flow from UI to storage to database. Verify file metadata is correctly stored. Test error scenarios like network failures, invalid files, and storage quota exceeded. Validate cleanup on failed uploads.
