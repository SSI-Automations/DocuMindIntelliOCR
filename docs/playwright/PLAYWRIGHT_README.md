# Playwright End-to-End Testing Guide

This document provides instructions on how to run Playwright tests and view their reports for this project.

## install

pnpm exec playwright install

## Running Tests

To run all Playwright tests, ensure your Next.js development server is running. Playwright is configured to automatically start it for you using `pnpm dev`.

Once the server is running (or Playwright starts it), open your terminal in the project root and execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright test
```

### Running Specific Tests

You can run tests for a specific file by providing the path to the test file:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright test tests/example.spec.ts
```

### Running Tests in UI Mode

For an interactive experience to explore, run, and debug tests with a time-travel experience, use the UI mode:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright test --ui
```

### Running Tests in Debug Mode

To debug tests with the Playwright Inspector, use the `--debug` flag:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright test --debug
```

## Viewing Test Reports

After running the tests, an HTML report is generated by default. To view the latest test report, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright show-report
```

This will open a browser window displaying a detailed report of your test runs, including passed, failed, and skipped tests, along with traces and screenshots for failed tests.

### Running Tests by Tag

Playwright allows you to organize and run tests based on tags. Tags are typically defined within the test title (e.g., `test('my test @smoke', ...)`) or using `test.describe.configure({ tags: ['smoke', 'regression'] });`.

To run tests with a specific tag, use the `--grep` flag:
